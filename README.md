# Architecture & Domain Mapping

Welcome to the arhictecture and domain section of our project.

The insurnace world is complicated, however, it extends from some very basic constructs.  Like many software and IT system challengs, we reduce to common patterns, then solve for the exception.

The architecture section seeks to provide a comprehensive list and reference architecture for the insurnace domain, including some of the following 
* covered items
* policies
* risk 
* insurnace products 
* premiums
* payouts
* re-insurnace
* re-investment
just to name a few.

# Taxonomy
The first part of this project is to arrange the taxonomy of the insurnace world.  Much has been done on this already, so we will not reinvent the wheel, but rather link out to other projects more suited to host this information with more vibrant communities. 

Again, the purpose is not to compete but to compliment - so what can we do to augment the amazing body of work that exists.

To get us started, there are generally 6 domains within the insurnace world that need exploration
1. Product domain
2. Policy domain
3. Cover domain
4. Payment domain
5. Claim domain
6. Insurance domain

We will explore each deeper below - but you will also find section in this repo for way more detail
