# House Systems Categories
To classify the covered items in a policy, we need to have common categories to reference.

This document outlines the categories with some examples

This information is used when defining Cap Limits in Policies.  It will be mapped to 8 bit number, and a 16 bit unsigned integer for the covered amounts.

this will give us a 255 categories and 65k values for cap limits.  Cap limits will be in $1,000s, so max cap limit for any given category would be $65M - more than enough.

## Home Major Categroies

### 1. **Structural Components**
   - **Foundation**: The base on which the house is built. Examples include concrete slab foundations and crawl space foundations.
   - **Roof**: The top covering of a house. Examples include asphalt shingles and metal roofing.

### 2. **Exterior Components**
   - **Siding**: The protective material attached to the exterior of the house. Examples include vinyl siding and brick.
   - **Windows**: Openings on the walls fitted with glass. Examples include double-hung windows and casement windows.

### 3. **Interior Components**
   - **Walls**: The vertical structures that divide the space in a house. Examples include drywall and plaster walls.
   - **Flooring**: The surface of the floor in a house. Examples include hardwood flooring and ceramic tile.

### 4. **Plumbing System**
   - **Pipes and Drains**: Channels for water and waste throughout the house. Examples include PVC pipes for drainage and copper pipes for water supply.
   - **Fixtures**: Appliances or devices that use water. Examples include toilets and faucets.

### 5. **Electrical System**
   - **Wiring**: Conducts electricity throughout the house. Examples include copper wire (used in most modern homes) and aluminum wire (used in some older homes).
   - **Outlets and Switches**: Points for electrical access and control. Examples include standard electrical outlets and dimmer switches.

### 6. **HVAC System (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning)**
   - **Heating System**: Devices that provide heat to the house. Examples include furnaces and boilers.
   - **Cooling System**: Devices that cool down the house. Examples include central air conditioning systems and window air conditioners.

### 7. **Insulation**
   - **Thermal Insulation**: Materials used to reduce heat loss or heat gain by providing a barrier between areas that are significantly different in temperature. Examples include fiberglass insulation and spray foam insulation.
   - **Sound Insulation**: Materials used to prevent sound from traveling between rooms or from outside to inside. Examples include acoustic panels and insulated drywall.

### 8. **Appliances**
   - **Major Appliances**: Large electrical or mechanical machines that accomplish a specific task. Examples include refrigerators and dishwashers.
   - **Small Appliances**: More portable or semi-portable machines, generally used on tabletops, countertops, or other platforms. Examples include microwaves and toasters.

### 9. **Roofing Components**
   - **Gutters**: Channels installed around the roof edges to carry rainwater away from the house. Examples include seamless gutters and sectional gutters.
   - **Downspouts**: Pipes that carry water from gutters to the ground or drainage system. Examples include round downspouts and rectangular downspouts.

### 10. **Security Systems**
   - **Alarms**: Systems designed to detect unauthorized entry into a building or area. Examples include burglar alarms and smoke alarms.
   - **Cameras**: Devices used to monitor and record physical spaces for security purposes. Examples include surveillance cameras and doorbell cameras.

### 11. **Home Automation**
   - **Smart Thermostats**: Devices that can be programmed and controlled to manage home temperatures remotely. Examples include the Nest thermostat and Ecobee.
   - **Home Assistants**: Smart devices that help with controlling various aspects of the home environment. Examples include Amazon Echo and Google Home.

Understanding these components can significantly enhance a system architectâ€™s ability to design integrated solutions that improve the functionality and efficiency of home environments.
